 
I'm learning my first real language, Python, and the local dev community introduced me to Git, and I'm just floored. Thank you for this video,
 for sharing your knowledge, your instructions and explanations are clear, they are easy to follow, and I'm as newbie as you can get. I liked your video,
 I subscribed, thanks again :D?

I'm in the exact same situation. I also really appreciate this video and what GitHub offers to newbie and veteran programmers alike. :)?
